This tower defense game is focused on moving towers. Each round the player receives one token, which can be used to buy towers. The tower shoot enemies on their path to the player's home. The twist is that tower can be picked up and placed down somewhere else. At the start of the game, there are multiple paths to the end and the player can only afford one tower.
This project was based off one of the first games I made in Unity. After several more years of experience, a came back and updated many aspects. One updated feature was the enemy pathing, which was originally on a rigid grid and is now on a smooth spline path. There is also a new UI for selecting which tower to buy and placing it. Lastly, there are a few more tower and enemies.
